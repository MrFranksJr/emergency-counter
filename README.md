# Emergency Counter
## Overview
Emergency Counter is a very simple page, with a counter on it (part of the [Scrimba](scrimba.com) courses)
Objective was to just build a simple counter.

I live very close to an ambulance / fire truck depot. I decided to build a counter that counts every single one of the vehicles that passes by :)
